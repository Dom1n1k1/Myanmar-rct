**Partners and roles.** IPA coordinated data collection; Brown Univ. PIs designed the RCT and analysis; Common Health implemented Bright Start; Terre des hommes recruited and listed eligible households; UNICEF supported funding and M&E.

**Intervention.** Bright Start offers three components to pregnant women and children under 6: hospital cash insurance (MMK 55,000 per hospitalization), telemedicine primary care, and an outpatient benefits package at enrollment. Coverage is provisioned at enrollment, with a 30-day wait period on insurance claims.

**Design.** Cluster RCT in two Yangon townships (Hlaing Thar Yar and Shwe Pyi Thar). Clusters of eligible households were randomized to treatment or control. The protocol indicates assignment aimed to keep streets or wards together. Respondent is the main female. Questions cover eligible members.

**Sample.** Sampling frame assembled by Tdh via phone recruitment. 4,399 households listed (6,013 individuals). Target analytic sample 2,942 households split 1:1 treatment vs control with 883 in SPT and 2,059 in HTY. Baseline completed with 3,210 households Oct 11 to Nov 3, 2021.

**Outcomes pre-specified.**
- Access and utilization: telehealth, outpatient care, hospital insurance.
- Financial protection: out of pocket health expenditure and financial resilience.
- Information on maternal and child health and COVID-19.

**Power assumptions** (household is the intervention unit). Baseline outpatient use 0.15 with +0.05 pp effect; hospitalization baseline 5 percent with +1.5 pp change; mean OOP level and a 5 to 6 USD reduction; ICC about 0.3; alpha 0.05; attrition assumed 20 to 30 percent.

**Waves and timing.** Baseline before program. Midline with about 500 households after 1 to 3 months to diagnose use. Endline about 12 months after baseline.

**Short run impacts expected.** Increased primary care via telemedicine. Increased outpatient use. Possible changes in hospital care seeking through insurance. Improved financial resilience.
